**Degoogling myself**

Google is everywhere, and pretty much everybody uses their services. I do use them everyday too, like Google Pay or their search engine.

However, they are a bit too intrusive for my liking. So after browsing some great sites like the [r/degoogle](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/) subreddit and [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/), I took some steps towards restoring my privacy :

- Use [Posteo](https://posteo.de) instead of Gmail for my emails
- Host my [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance at home instead of using Google Drive
- Use Linux distributions like [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) or [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) instead of Windows (It's Microsoft but they are privacy invaders too)
- Generally, use open-source alternative to services provided by GAFAMs.

**Using a rooted Android phone everyday**

After having updated all of my computers to highly customizable Linux distros, I was missing the same control on my phone.

To that, the answer was at first, a new phone. I chose the Poco X3 Pro for its good price/performance ratio. I also chose it because it's supported by many custom Android ROMs.

I installed the TWRP recovery, ArrowOS and rooted the device with Magisk. So far, it works great. Here are some of the benefits I get from doing this :

- System wide ad blocking with AdAway
- Fully featured backups with Migrate and Swift Backup
- No manufacturer installed apps that pollutes my phone
- Much better battery life
- No broken apps because of root / custom ROM with Magisk
- Kept the ability to use minimal Google services

However, here are some downsides to expect :

- If my phone has a problem, I may not be able to use its guarantee because of the unlocked bootloader
- Increased vulnerability because of root
- Updating the software is more complicated
- Less stability than the stock configuration

But overall, I love it.

You can learn more about my rooting process on my [Notion page](https://terencech.notion.site/Modding-Poco-X3-Pro-60746cf2824b45e5b7c776ca95eaf0ee).
